# orf

A minimal version control interface, built in [Go](https://go.dev/). Inspired by Linus Torvald's [git](https://git-scm.com/).

## What is orf?
`orf` can mean anything, depending on your mood.

- a whimsical three-letter jumble that's neither found in UNIX or everyday language.

- odd + peculiar. Take it as a nod to the unconventional.

- "optimal resource finder": in a good mood, you might see it as a clever tool that uncovers hidden truths in your files.

- "obnoxiously redundant fiasco": when things go awry, and you wonder why you even bothered in the first place.

While `orf` might not accomplish much, it does with an odd charm for tracking content in a strange rudimentary sense.
